=== Exploiting Covert Channels

Covert channels are vulnerabilities, i.e. potential tools for an attacker to exfiltrate confidential data.

Covert channels act as building blocks for an exploit. They are not the exploit itself, which refers to the end-to-end technique enabling an attacker to compromise a system, extract data, or maintain unauthorized access.

// Explicitely mention that the official MDS definition makes no sense ?

In this document, we divide the exploit into two families depending if the targeted secret is legitimately used by the application or not.

In the Microarchitectural Data Sampling family of attacks
(<<microarchitectural-data-sampling>>), secret values are legitimately handled
by the application and leaked through a covert channel.

In the Spectre family of attacks (<<spectre-attacks>>), secret value are
readable but should never have been accessed in a vulnerable manner.
Meltdown attacks are considered here as a subclass of Spectre attacks.
