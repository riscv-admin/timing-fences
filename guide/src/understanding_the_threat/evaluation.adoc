=== Evaluating covert channels

The possibility of preventing covert channels in the microarchitecture implies evaluating them.
Are covert channels possible? How much data can they transmit per second?

The question of how to evaluate covert channels accurately and efficiently is not settled: there is no single technique used for that purpose.
As a communication channel, a covert channel has a channel capacity, as defined by C. Shannon, i.e. a maximum information transmission bandwidth.
