== Linting

The linting of code/documentation can be categorized as dealing with formatting, syntax, or semantics.  Once the rules for a given project are defined, many of these rules can be checked automatically with tooling.

=== Tooling

https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit tool] is a very useful, open source, well maintained, and popular tool/framework to help automate linting checks in general.  It provides some of the following key features:

* https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html[a great number of support hooks for linting]
** including direct support by many of the maintainers of best in class linters (ex: https://github.com/psf/black[python linter black])
** https://pre-commit.com/index.html#plugins[hook plugins] allow adding these and versioning to control updates
* support for https://pre-commit.com/index.html#new-hooks[creating new custom hooks easily]
* can be run before `git commit` (i.e. "pre-commit") so authors can detect and fix problems sooner in the workflow
* can also be run in https://pre-commit.com/index.html#github-actions-example[continuous integration (CI)] to ensure checks are run for every pull request
