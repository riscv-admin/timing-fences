== AsciiDoc authoring for RISC-V contributors

AsciiDoc is the markup language and Asciidoctor is a set of toolchains that support publishing from AsciiDoc.

Asciidoctor toolchains:

* https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[asciidoctor], which is well-established and written in ruby.
* https://gitlab.com/antora/antora[antora], which is newer and written in javascript.
* Python-based, which is legacy and in maintenance mode.

=== RISC-V AsciiDoc authoring assets

Please view the https://github.com/riscv/docs-templates[readme] in the docs-templates repo for information about the automated build processes.

The docs-templates repo also contains assets, such as fonts, styles, directory structure, and themes that you need for RISC-V specifications, along with a https://github.com/riscv/docs-dev-guide/blob/main/local_build.md[document] that takes you through a local install process that supports all of the required features for a local build.

Although testing your markup by building a PDF is good practice, you can catch many common errors by simply downloading Asciidoctor and building the HTML output by using the following command:

[source,cmd]
----
asciidoctor book_header.adoc
----

=== Writing

To begin writing in AsciiDoc, select a text editor. Here's <<editors>>.

For quick reference, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference]. Most of the markup for the specifications is simple and should have a familiar feel to those who have used Git-flavored Markdown. For RISC-V specifications, it is the procedures for <<graphics>> that add complexity.

The https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-writers-guide/[AsciiDoc Writers Guide] contains details about AsciiDoc markup.

==== Text editors with AsciiDoc support

There isn't a true WYSIWYG editor for AsciiDoc. However, there are live preview options that are listed in the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/tooling/[Asciidoctor documentation] that can help you see what the output looks like. You can also use your favorite text editor, or perhaps switch to one that has good AsciiDoc linting.
