=== Exploiting Covert Channels

Covert channels are tools for an attacker to exfiltrate confidential data.
They are a compontent to build an exploit, not the exploit itself.

// Explicitely mention that the official MDS definition makes no sense ?

In the Microarchitectural Data Sampling family of attacks (<<microarchitectural-data-sampling>>), secret values are legitimately handled by the application and leaked through a covert channel.

In the Spectre family of attacks (<<spectre-attacks>>), secret value are readable but should never have been accessed in a vulnerable manner.
