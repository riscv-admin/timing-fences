=== Exploiting Covert and Side Channels

Covert and side channels are tools for an attacker to exfiltrate confidential data.
They are a compontent to build an exploit, not the exploit itself.

// Explicitely mention that the official MDS definition makes no sense ?

In the Microarchitectural Data Sampling family of attacks
(<<microarchitectural-data-sampling>>), secret values are legitimately handled
by the application and leaked through indirect access to microarchitectural
state.

In the Spectre family of attacks (<<spectre-attacks>>), secret values are leaked
by microarchitectual access to architectural state on behalf of the attacker.
