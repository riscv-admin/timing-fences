== RISC-V style for Vale

The RISC-V style for Vale enforces the rules that are set by the RISC-V style guidelines. 

=== Abbreviations

Do not use punctuation in abbreviations.

=== Anthropomorphism

Anthropomorphism is granting abilities to inanimate objects, such as "This code allows you to enable access." Instead, make the user the focus of the sentence: "You can use this code to enable access." 

=== Camel case

If you are using Camel case (`camelCase`), consider using backticks.

=== Case sensitive terms

Terms such as RISC-V are case sensitive. If your usage is in code, then be sure to place back ticks around the code phrase.

=== Conjunctions

Do not overuse conjunctions when you begin a sentence, including the following conjunctions:

* And
* But
* Or
* So

=== Contractions

Avoid using contractions in Extension documentation. Contractions can cause ambiguity with translations.

=== Ellipses

Avoid ellipses (...) to indicated omitted words. Instead, spell out the complete phrase or use words such as "and so on" to indicate that a list is not complete.

=== Em dashes

Avoid em dashes. Instead use commas, parenthesis, or colons.

=== First person

Do not use words such as "I" or "we", unless you are indeed speaking on behalf of all of RISC-V.

=== Gender neutral language

Avoid using language that specifies a gender, such as "he" or "woman". Instead, use words such as "the author" or "human".

=== Heading punctuation

Do not use punctuation in headings.

=== Heading

Headings use Title case: all nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are capitalized. Do not capitalize conjunctions, prepositions, or articles.

=== Hyphens

Do not use hyphens unless that usage is approved. See Spelling.

=== Merge conflict markers

Do not include any Git merge conflict markers in your source text. For example, `<<<<<<< HEAD`.

=== Oxford comma

Use the Oxford comma. It saves lives.

=== Pascal case

If you are using Pascal case (`PascalCase`), consider using backticks.

=== Repeated words

Words such as "the" or "and" can end up duplicated in text. 

=== Sentence length

Try to keep sentences to an average of 32 words or fewer, and vary sentence lengths.

=== Slash

Rather than use a slash, use either "or" or "and".

=== Spacing

Use one space between words and after the end of sentences.

=== Spelling

The dictionary chosen for RISC-V is Webster's New College dictionary. You can find it online at https://www.yourdictionary.com/about/websters-new-world-college-dictionary.html[Webster's New World College Dictionary].

RISC-V works with cutting edge technology and new words are to be expected. If you want to use a word that is not found in the Dictionary, you must first create an issue in the https://github.com/riscv-admin/riscv-vale/[Vale GitHub] repository. Your issue will be discussed at the Doc-Sig meeting. Please include the rationale for why your term should be included as well as any definitions that your term requires.  If approved, your term will be added to the spelling exception list as well as to the https://github.com/riscv/riscv-glossary[RISC-V glossary].

=== Using

To avoid ambiguity, replace "using" with either "by using" or "that uses". Do not omit articles and prepositions that can increase the clarity of a sentence.
