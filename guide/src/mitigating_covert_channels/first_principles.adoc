=== First Principles

To counter covert channels, designers must guarantee timing independence across security domains :

[quote]
The timing of execution in a security domains must be independant from the execution in other security domains.

Easier said than done, how to design a microarchitecture respecting this principle is still largely unknown.

Today, the consensus is to guarantee state partioning, mainly in its two flavors temporal and spatial partioning.
Temporal partitioning, discussed in <<temporal-partitioning>>, focuses on how to properly execute security domains, one at a time.
Wherease spatial partitioning (<<spatial-partitioning>>), discusses how to have security domains coexisting in the microarchitecure to switch quickly between domains.
