=== Temporal Partitioning

Temporal partitioning means that at any given time, the microarchitectural state is exclusively associated with a single security domain.

For example, branch predictors are not always cleared when switching between processes, or when changing the privilege level. In this case, it becomes possible for an attacker to create a covert channel leveraging this microarchitectural state.

To prevent covert channels, switching to a new domain requires flushing the entire microarchitectural state, which can be prohibitively slow in some cases. 
Branch predictors state must flushed, cache memories must be flushed, finite state machined must be reseted into a default state, ...
