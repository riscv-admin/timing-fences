// IMPORTANT: Each author should make sure that revnumber, revdate, and revremark
// are set to proper values. Whenever the status of a spec changes, or a new
// release is done, these should be updated to reflect that. NO OVERRIDES of
// these values through the Makefile or command-line should be done, to ensure
// that the proper versioning is captured in the git commits.
// See also the Build Infrastructure section near the end of this document, or
// src/build-infrastructure.adoc
:revnumber: v0.2.0-example (git SHA {git_sha})
// If desired, uncomment this and hard-code a date.
//:revdate: today
:revremark: Pre-release version
//development: assume everything can change
//stable: assume everything could change
//frozen: if you implement this version you assume the risk that something might change because of the public review cycle  but we expect little to no change.
//ratified: you can implement this and be assured nothing will change. if something needs to change due to an errata or enhancement, it will come out in a new extension. we do not revise extensions.
