= Reveal.js presentations using asciidoc

When using the Asciidoctor toolchain, you have the option of enabling Reveal.js presentations written in AsciiDoc.

For some uses, this can save you time.

Some training departments make use of Reveal.js presentations to support the rolling out of updated information in response to rapidly changing needs in dynamic environments.
