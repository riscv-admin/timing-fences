== AsciiDoc needs Asciidoctor

- To author in AsciiDoc, you must install Aciidoctor.

- To install Asciidoctor, you must install Ruby.

- To create a pdf from AsciiDoc, you must insall asciidoctor-pdf and a few additional rubies.

== Install Ruby on Mac

Asciidoctor's Web site recommends installing Ruby using RVM, and then Asciidoctor.

RVM is essential for creating PDF files because the PDF build requires Ruby version 2.7.x.

RVM is a Ruby installation and version manager. RVM works by installing Ruby inside your home directory and manages the environment variables to allow you to switch between the system-wide Ruby and any Ruby installed using RVM.

- Install RVM along with the latest version of Ruby:
----
$ \curl -#L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --autolibs=3 --ruby
----

RVM will download and build the Ruby language, install RubyGems along with several essential gems and configure your PATH environment variable.

- Source your shell configuration (only necessary in the window you used to install RVM):
----
$ source $HOME/.bash_profile
----

- Remove your local Gem configuration, if you have one (or move it out of the way):
----
$ rm -f $HOME/.gemrc
----

== Mac--use Ruby on Mac


When using RVM, you can switch between the system-wide Ruby and RVM-managed Ruby using these two commands:

- Switch to system-wide Ruby
----
$ rvm use system
----

- Switch to RVM-managed verions 2.7.2 for use in building pdf:
----
$ rvm use 2.7.2
----

== Install Asciidoctor on Mac

- Install Asciidoctor:
----
$ gem install asciidoctor
----

- Verify Asciidoctor is installed by executing the asciidoctor command:
----
$ asciidoctor --version
----

If you see the Asciidoctor version information printed in the terminal, then youâ€™re already able to build html from an .adoc file using:

----
asciidcotor filename.adoc
----

== Windows--install Ruby with RVM

- For Windows, use:
----
http://rubyinstaller.org/
----

Note: During the install, click in the installer to
- associate the .rvm with the current version
- add paths
- add tdtk

== Windows--add the Asciidoctor gem

- Navigate to the following url

----
https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor/
----

- Scroll down to the latest version and click the *download* button.

- In Powershell, use the following command to install the Asciidoctor gem:

----
$ gem install asciidoctor <path-to-dowloaded-gem>
----

== Both Win and Mac, for pdf's

Install the asciidoctor-pdf gem, which is needed for pdf rendering:
----
$ gem install asciidoctor-pdf --pre --source http://rubygems.org
----

== Add syntax highlighting gems for AsciiDoc output

Install syntax highlighting gems as follows (for Windows, append the string --source http://rubygems.org to each command):
----
gem install coderay
gem install rouge
gem install pygments
----

== Optional, additional font

----
https://octicons.github.com/
----

== AsciiDoc headers


:NOTE: The headers are already in the template files, so there's no need to add or change anything in them.

== Create and name a new .adoc file

- In your text editor, create a new file.
- Assign a name and save with the .adoc extension.
- In the first line, use a single "=" to indicate a document title and create the title.
- Start with the settings above and change them as needed.
:NOTE: Blank lines are not allowed in the headers.
- You have the option of using one long file or adding files using includes like the following:
----
include::copyright.adoc[]
include::intro.adoc[]
include::requirements.adoc[]
----

== Build static documentation only

To build content from AsciiDoc files on your own machine:

- CD into the directory that contains your adoc files.
- If some files reference other files, the build usually runs from the directory that contains the  the adoc file with headers.

- For html output, use the command line to run:
----
asciidoctor filename.adoc
----

For pdf output using the YAML file customizations:

----
asciidoctor-pdf book_template.adoc -a pdf-style=resources/themes/risc-v_spec-pdf.yml -a pdf-fontsdir=resources/fonts
----
