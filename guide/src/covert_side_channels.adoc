=== Covert and Side Channels

The ability of an attacker to exfiltrate and retrieve a secret can be viewed as
the establishment of a communication channel. The attackerâ€™s goal is to
establish this communication channel across a security boundary.

For example, this could allow a user-mode process to read a secret manipulated
during a system call executed in supervisor mode.

Like any communication channel, there is an emitter (often called the Trojan)
trying to communicate the secret to the receiver (often called the Spy). Two
threat models are usually considered:

* *Covert Channels* refer to communication channels where both the Trojan
  and Spy are controlled by the attacker.
* *Side Channels* refer to communication channels where only the Spy is under
  the attacker's control. In this model, the Trojan's role is inadvertently
  played by the victim.

Communication channels can take several forms. A secret can be
communicated, or leaked, as secret-dependent power consumption measured with an
oscilloscope. Or a function's duration may depend on secret data; in this case,
the channel is a timing (covert or side) channel.

Looking at timing channels in a CPU, two main causes can be found:

* *Architectural timing channels* occurs when a program executes different
  instructions, or the same instructions with different architectural
  side-effects, using a secret. For example, by branching on a condition
  involving a secret value, or by a multiplication having a latency dependent
  on the inputs. Architectural timing channels are software vulnerabilities as
  they arise from the instructions and data operated on by a program: they
  should not occur in security-minded programs.
* *Microarchitectural timing channels* occur due to changes in
  microarchitectural structures as a result of the execution of a sequence of
  instructions that may or may not be committed. Therefore, this type of timing
  channels can occur even in the absence of architectural timing channels, with
  a correct software implementation. In this case, timing variation can still
  occur due to the hardware implementation. For example, a _load_ instruction
  whose address is secret-dependent can induce a covert channel because of the
  cache hierarchy.

[NOTE]
.Constant time programming
====
Constant time programming is a programming methodology that aims to generate
a program that doesn't leak secret data through a timing channel. It
encompasses the set of techniques (programming patterns, compiler
configurations, ...) to achieve said result. Beware, depending on the context,
constant time programming may only consider architectural timing channels and
declare microarchitectural leakage out of scope.
====

Microarchitectural timing channels are caused by microarchitectural structures
(buffers, finite state machines, ...) necessary to improve the performance of
the microarchitecture. Timing variation is there on purpose: for example, cache
memories introduce timing variability between hit and miss entries to optimize
repetitive memory accesses. As such, microarchitectural timing channels are not
due to hardware implementation error per se, but rather to misusing this
implementation. Hardware techniques to limit covert channels are discussed in
<<mitigating-covert-channels>>.

*Any microarchitectural state that depends on execution history and impacts
timing can be used to implement a covert channel.* This includes cache
memories, branch predictors, other kinds of buffers (TLBs, fetch buffers, trace
buffers, ...), even finite state machines.
