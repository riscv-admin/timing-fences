=== Covert and Side Channels

The ability of an attacker to exfiltrate and retrieve a secret can be viewed as the establishment of a communication channel.
The attackerâ€™s goal is to establish this communication channel across a security boundary.

For example, this could allow a user-mode process to read a secret manipulated during a system call executed in supervisor mode.

Like any communication channel, there is an emitter (often called the Trojan) trying to communicate the secret to the receiver (often called the Spy).
Two threat models are usually considered:

* *Covert Channels* refer to the communication channels where both the Trojan and Spy are controlled by the attacker.
* *Side Channels* refer to communication channels where only the Spy is under the attacker's control. In this model, the Trojan's role is inadvertently played by the victim.


These communication channels can take several forms.
A secret can be leaked as a dependent power consumption, measured with an oscilloscope.
Or a function's duration may depend on secret data; in this case, the channel is a timing (covert or side) channel.

// Architectural timing channels

// Microarchitectural timing channels
